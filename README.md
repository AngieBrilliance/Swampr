Swampr - A basic blogging app in Flask
======================================
This is an app we're using to learn Flask. It has some really basic components in it, and serves as a simple blog app:
- Skeleton Flask files to launch an app (we began with "Hello, world!")
- A models file that declares our classes (Post and User)
- A forms file that defines forms for adding new users and adding new posts.
- And Three views.
